# Procedural-World-Generation
A GUI C++ program using SFML and implementing perlin noise to create a believable endless world while being non ram or cpu intensive.

# how to use:
• w-a-s-d for movement.

• Mouse weel for zoom in/out.

# side notes:
• Zooming out may reduce fps by a lot.

• This was designed with modularity and scalability in mind and thus the highly organized code.

• In /setup/init.h at line 23 you can edit the window size.

• In /setup/init.h at line 32 you can edit the world seed. (Default=1337)

• The textures where created with Gimp.
